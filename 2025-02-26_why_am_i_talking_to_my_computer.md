# Why am I talking to my computer?

So why am I talking to my computer? It's a chance to try all the blogging that I've been half-arsely thinking about for five years. I do wonder how much of the nuance gets lost with the voice tone. The question from here is how I'm going to take this raw text dump and slice it up and make it readable, or at least into something vaguely coherent. In the meantime this is really just a small test to make sure that I can get it into Markdown format and put it in the directory and push it up to GitHub.

What don't I like about it? Is there anything in particular? Not really. I guess there's something wrong with the summaries and the bluffs that it generates. They always seem just a little bit too matter of fact, like not quite enough nuance or something like that.Or at least there's not really any artistry in them. I wonder if you could coax a bit more life out of it with some good prompting. It's already obviously a little bit annoying to have to go back and just literally copy edit this stuff in terms of adding spaces and punctuation and things so I can see why A good wrapper API call would be useful there. 

What else would I want this thing to do? I guess it would be nice if I could have it add at least a title and then rename the file according to the title automatically. It would be nice if I could add the date in the specific format to the start of the file name automatically. It would be nice if maybe it could generate a little table of contents, although that might not happen; and table of contents with a little BLUF on each link. And ideally, you'd be able to show these Markdown files in a narrow column. So some extremely limited styling. I think at that point you're sort of talking about a blog generator really aren't you?

Something like tags, I mean, is generally interesting. If it could auto-generate tagsâ€¦ that's a whole subtopic unto itself that will be sort of fun to play with. I guess there is a world where the blog that starts as a repo of Markdown files ends up becoming some kind of proof of concept of the dream of the semantic web. Where the model knows everything already, and understands what it is, and it can generate connections and links organically without you having to do any of that. 

And in principle you could use a copilot to help you code an interface to do that, or or even just have the blog system itself somehow kind of bake it in. And then at that point you're basically designing some kind of custom-built memex and/or young lady's illustrated primer. Hey, I think there's another thing I would like it to do, which is automatically add links to something useful. And while I'm at it, automatically add things like this as footnotes. 

But for now, let's stick with the repo of Markdown files.
